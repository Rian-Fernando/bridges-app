I’m developing a web-based scheduling application called Bridges, designed specifically for the Bridges to Adelphi program at Adelphi University, which supports neurodiverse students through structured academic, social, and vocational support. The program involves various meeting types, such as Learning Strategist (LS), COMBO meetings, Vocational Coach (VC), Social Coach (SC), Academic Coach (AC), and Check-ins. These meetings are conducted by either student staff or professional staff members, all organized within specific departments. Each semester begins with both students and staff filling out detailed forms. Students provide their course schedules, commuting status, availability throughout the week, preferences for meeting formats (remote or in-person), and whether they like meetings back-to-back or spaced out. Staff members submit similar information, including their availability, courses they’re taking or teaching, departments they belong to, subjects they specialize in, and their preferred meeting types.

Currently, the entire scheduling process is managed manually through Google Sheets. These spreadsheets are used to record availability, match students with staff based on preferences and subject needs, and track schedules. Sheets are also used for notifying staff through @mentions, managing changes that occur during the semester—such as dropped courses, student-staff incompatibility, or parent-initiated requests—and logging these disruptions in a separate “conflict” tracker for future scheduling awareness. Each meeting that takes place requires a report from the staff member, which is then reviewed by a supervisor who verifies its contents and acknowledges whether progress has been made, or if the meeting was missed, cancelled, or not held at all. This documentation ensures accountability but adds significant manual overhead.

To simplify this strenuous process, I plan to build the Bridges app to automate and intelligently manage the entire workflow. The application will automate the pairing of students and staff based on their submitted form data while also integrating logic to determine the feasibility of in-person meetings—especially for commuting staff who should not be asked to travel to campus for just one session. The app will feature a transparent weekly schedule view for both students and staff, clearly showing who they are meeting, at what time, where the meeting will take place (remote or specific room), and the type of meeting. Staff will also be able to submit reports directly through the platform, with supervisors having access to review and confirm them efficiently. Additionally, all scheduling conflicts and adjustments will be logged in one central system, making future scheduling more informed and less chaotic.

The design of the application will follow a hybrid visual approach that combines Apple’s clean, minimal user interface with Adelphi University’s branding elements, using both modern design principles and institutional identity. The app will launch first as a web-based system, with the potential to expand into a mobile version later depending on user needs and adoption.
